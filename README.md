This has been deprecated in favor of using a [template](https://github.com/singlecell-batches/cookiecutter-reproducible-science)


## How to use this repository


1.  Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.)
    You must be logged in for the remaining steps to work.

2.  Go to [GitHub's importer][importer].

3.  Paste the url of this repo as the old repository to clone:
    <https://github.com/singelecell-batches/algorithm-template>.

4.  Select the owner for your new repository.
    (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)

5.  Choose a name for your workshop website repository. This name should have
    the form `algorithmname-firstauthorYYYY`, where the algorithm name is
    either its accepted abbreviation or your best shortening of the name, and
    YYYY is the publication date of the most recent publication which explains
    the math behind the code. If there is a preprint AND peer-reviewed
    publication out, use the peer-revied year, otherwise the preprint's year.
    For exmaple, `seuratalignment-butler2017`

6.  Make sure the repository is public.

7.  At this point, you should have a page like this:

    ![](fig/using-github-import.png?raw=true)

    You can now click "Begin Import". When the process is done, you will
    receive a message like "Importing complete! Your new repository
    singlecell-batches/seuratalignment-butler2017 is ready." and you can go to the new repository
    by clicking on the name.

8. To download the repository, first change to your `singlecell-batches`
   folder. E.g. if you keep all your github repositories in a `~/code` folder:
    ```
    cd ~/code/singlecell-batches
    ```
9. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/singlecell-batches/seuratalignment-butler2017
    ```
   Which would create a folder called `seuratalignment-butler2017` on your
   computer.
10. Change the README file to use the template

    ```
